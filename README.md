# AI Image Generated NFT Minter

## Overview
Hello, my name is Javier Montes Carrera and this is my AI Image Generated NFT Minter project. It aims to create a system for generating and minting NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) using AI image generation. The project integrates account abstraction using Web3Auth, allowing users to interact with the system without having to manage their own cryptocurrency wallets.
