# AI Image Generated NFT Minter

## Overview
Hello, my name is Javier Montes Carrera and this is my AI Image Generated NFT Minter project (iArt NFTs). It aims to create a system for generating and minting NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) using AI image generation. The project has 2 fromtends: a website and a Farcaster frame.
